# What to Focus On

1. Develop a clear understanding of the role of HTTP in combination og multiple different technologies
2. Break HTTP and URLs into specific components and the purpose of each.

# The Application Layer 
1. Application layer is not the application itself, but rather a set of protocols which provide communication services to the application. The protocols at the application layer are the ones that the application itself most directly interacts with. Some application interact with the transport layer. It is less common to build applications that interact directly with protocols below the transports layer. 

2. The layer is focus on the structure of that message and the dat the it should contain.


3. ISO: will not talk about the layers below since they will complicate the mental model
    - session layer
    - presentation layer 
    
4. Application Layer Protocols: different rules for how different applications talk to each other at a syntactical level.
    - rules for email client to email server (SMTP, POP, IMAP)
    - web browser to web server (HTTP)

# HTTP and the Web

1. The Web is a service hosted on a web server that can be accessed via the internet. The servers stores avast information system comprised of resources which are navigable by means of a URL, which takes you the appropriate web server. It is the primary means by which application interact with the resources which make up the web. 

2. a network of sub-networks that transmits bits over different divices with the help of protocols to govern the transmission of data from source to distination device. 

## History 

1. lots of information stored in different countries. Although the commputers were connected over the network, the information sotred on them was difficult to access. 

2. Hypertext created an accesible information system that exist on various computers as structured resources. These resources coule all be connected to each other using hyperlinks in order to create a world-wide web of information.

3. The system required: 
    - uniformity of the structure of the resources to be rendering correctly for viewing (HTML provided uniform structure)
    - uniformity of the address so that resources are located (URI is a string of characters that identifies a resource)

    - uniformity in the way a request for a resource was made and in the way that request was responded to. (HTTP is the set of rules which providr uniformity to the away resources on the web are transferred between appliations.)
