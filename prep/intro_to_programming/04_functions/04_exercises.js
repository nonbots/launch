//EX.1
/*
The code logs to the console 1. Executing foo() does not affect the output 
because the function created a new let variable named and assigned it with a 
value of 2. Since the variable is created inside the function scope is seperate
from the let bar variable in the global scope and since console.log is called in 
the global scope it only has access to the let bar variable in the global scope.
*/

//EX.4
/*
The program does not log anything because the return statement is executed
before the console.log statement.
*/

//EX.5
/*
The program does not log anythign because there is not console.log called to 
log the return value to the console.
