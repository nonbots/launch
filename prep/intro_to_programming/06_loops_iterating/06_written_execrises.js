//EX.3
/*
The program will run in an infinite loop because the while loop is assigning the 
counter to 1 each time the loop iterates. The counter will never be checked when 
it is assigned to 2 since it is being reassigned each time the loop restarts at line 3. 
Thus counter > 2 will never be true and the break will never be executed.

//EX.4 
/*
An error will not occur because the 3 components are optional and the incremental
component is declared in line 2.
